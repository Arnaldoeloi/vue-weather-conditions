# Vue Weather Conditions

![alt_text](https://github.com/Arnaldoeloi/vue-weather-conditions/blob/master/app_preview.png?raw=true)

This simple app will show you the current weather data from your location given the permission to see it. It'll also show you a famous quote to get you inspired.

You can check it working live on [https://arnaldoeloi.github.io/vue-weather-conditions/](https://arnaldoeloi.github.io/vue-weather-conditions/).




## Project setup

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arnaldoeloi/vue-weather-conditions.git
```

### Install the dependencies 

```
npm install
```

### Configure the app

Create your own [Open Weather account](https://openweathermap.org/) and copy your API key.

Create a .env file on the project's root and paste your API key 

```env
VUE_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY= YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE
```
 
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### How to use it

Once you have installed all the dependencies and ran ```npm run serve```, go to [localhost:8080/vue-weather-conditions](http://localhost:8080/vue-weather-conditions).

The browser will ask to know your location, agree with it and it'll show you the weather on your region right now. The default place, in case you don't agree to share the location (with no one but yourself) it'll show the city where the app was created: Natal, BR.
